"""Centralized lightweight Dash stubs.

Provides minimal drop-in standâ€‘ins for dash.html / dash.dcc components and
the Input/Output/State decorators so modules can be imported in
non-dashboard environments (e.g. headless validation, smoke import
checks, Pylance static analysis) without sprinkling `type: ignore`.

Usage:
    from core.stubs.dash_stubs import dash_safe_imports
    html, dcc, Input, Output, State, DASHBOARD_AVAILABLE = dash_safe_imports()

If dash is installed and importable, real objects are returned. Otherwise
simple callable stubs are provided. The stubs are intentionally *very*
small to avoid adding runtime cost.
